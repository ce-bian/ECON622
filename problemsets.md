# Problem Sets

<!-- Problem sets should be submitted as a *single* Jupyter notebook on Canvas, with the code and output clean. -->
- **Problem Set 1** - see Canvas
<!-- Due Tuesday, September 12 -->
<!--   - To possibly tailor course content to students' interests, please answer: -->
<!--       1. What is/are your field(s)? -->
<!--       2. Give an example of a paper with computations similar to what you'd like to be able to do. -->
<!--   - Exercises 7, 8(a), and 8(b) in [Introductory Examples](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/julia_by_example.html) -->
  <!-- - Redo any exercise of your choice from 1 to 6 in [Introductory Examples](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/julia_by_example.html) -->
  <!--   - In all "Redo" look at the provided solutions afterwards, but still submit your code -->
  <!-- - Exercise 7 in [Julia Essentials](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/julia_essentials.html) -->
- **Problem Set 2** - see Canvas
<!-- - **Problem Set 2** - Due Wednesday, September 21 -->
<!--   <\!-- -  Exercises 2 and  3 <\\!-- , and 4 -\\-> in [Fundamental Types](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/fundamental_types.html) -\-> -->
<!--   - Exercises 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in [Introduction to Types](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/introduction_to_types.html) -->

<!-- - **Problem Set 3** - Due Wednesday, October 5 -->
<!--   - Exercise 1 in [Generic Programming](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/generic_programming.html) -->
<!--   - Read [Kaplan, Moll, & Violante (2018)](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2008829729?accountid=14656) and outline the steps needed to reproduce their results. Your outline need not be especially detailed. Pay particular attention to how the project can be broken into smaller, relatively independent tasks. -->
<!--   - What's your github username or email? I will give you read/write access to https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_HANK (Sign up for a github account if you haven't already). -->

<!-- - **Problem Set 4** - Due Monday, October 17th -->
<!--     - Review [this pull request](https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_HANK/pull/9/files) -->
<!--     - Solve the optimal control problem for either households or intermediate goods firms. Create a branch for your code in https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_HANK/ . -->
<!--       Turn in your code by creating a pull request. -->

<!--   - Exercises 5 in [Introduction to Types](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/introduction_to_types.html) -->
<!--   - Exercise 1 in [Generic Programming](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/generic_programming.html) -->
<!-- - **Problem Set 4:** Due Thursday, February 10 -->
<!--   - Exercises 1a, 1b, 1c  in [Git and Github](https://julia.quantecon.org/software_engineering/version_control.html) OR Exercise 2a OR Exercise 2b -->
<!--     - For the git/github in your ipynb notebook add links to the various PRs or screenshots with some evidence that you executed the steps.  No need to do much about the formatting -->
<!--     - The easiest is certainly if you do all of this with public github repos, and then you can just provide links to the "evidence" -->
<!-- - **Problem Set 5:** Due Friday, February 18 -->
<!--   - Exercise 1 in [Testing and Packages](https://julia.quantecon.org/software_engineering/testing.html) Or -->
<!--   - Or contribute tests to another package (this could be your own package or some other public package) -->
<!-- - **Problem Set 6:** Due Thursday, March 10 -->
<!--   - Improve the performance of a piece of code. Preferrably, this would be code useful for your research, but it can be any code from a package, previous assignment, lecture, etc. Attempt to improve the code's performance. Include benchmarks of the initial version and your modified version. Briefly describe the things you tried. -->

<!-- - **Problem Set 6:** Due Thursday, October 29th -->
<!--   - Complete one of the exercises from [optimization algorithms](https://schrimpf.github.io/AnimatedOptimization.jl/exercises/) Turn in a link to a public git repo containing your work (preferred) or a jupyter notebook. -->
<!-- - **Problem Set 7:** Due Thursday, November 5th : either   -->
<!--   a) Work on one of the issues in [GMMInference.jl](https://github.com/schrimpf/GMMInference.jl/issues).  -->
<!--     - If you have a GMM model you're interested in, Issue #7 would be a good choice -->
<!--     - If you are interested in econometric theory, issues #5 and the second bullet of #8 are good and will require some research -->
<!--     - If you like thinking about code organization and package design, #2, #6, or #10 are relevant -->
<!--     - As with the previous assignment, you need not complete the task; make whatever progress you can in 6 hours or so. If you want your work to be added to the repository, either make a pull request or say so on whatever you turn in.  -->

<!--   or  -->
<!--   b) Contribute to another Julia package. This can be something modest like clarifying documentation, improving tests, or even creating an issue reporting a bug or thoughtfully requesting a feature. Check with me if you're unsure whether your plan is appropriate. -->
<!-- - **Problem Set 8:** Due Thursday, November 19th -->
<!--   - Improve the performance of a piece of code. Take some code from a package, previous assignment, or lecture and attempt to improve its performance. Include benchmarks of the initial version and your modified version. Briefly describe the things you tried.  -->
<!-- - **Problem Set 7:** -->
